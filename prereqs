Dear Class of CHL5260

For this week's doctoral seminar, I will be giving a short presentation/tutorial on how to write an R package and publish it on GitHub. If you want to follow along, please make sure you have the following three things set up on your computer.

1. Download R Studio (https://rstudio.com/)
2. Download Git (https://git-scm.com/)
3. Create a GitHub account (https://github.com/) 

If this is your first time creating a GitHub account, here are a few tips on choosing your username.

See you on Thursday,
